The adaptation of metastatic cells to their host tissue critically determines the pathogenicity of a cancer and therefore patient survival. Yet, it remains elusive to what extent the host environment drives gene expression programs in metastatic cells. Here we identify adaptive mechanisms that enable metastases to establish themselves in a novel tissue context. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on malignant and benign tissue samples from untreated donors with colorectal adenocarcinoma and liver metastasis to deduce tissue adaptive expression patterns. A novel computational approach identified genes and pathways that consistently adapted to the host tissue on the transition level from the primary tumor to the paired metastasis across donors. We validated these findings in two other patient cohorts and revealed that the majority of expression changes in the metastasis reflect an expression signature reminiscent of benign liver epithelial cells. Cellular processes adapting to the liver environment include basic cellular functions such as energy metabolism, as well as tissue-specific pathways such as the regulation of lipid metabolism by PPAR-Î±. These adaptations potentially increase the pathogenicity of the metastatic cells and may provide new therapeutic strategies.
